# Donald Watts  
**AI Workflow Architect  |  Symbolic Systems Engineer  |  Entropy-Reduction Specialist**

I build frameworks that keep creative chaos from turning into tech debt.



## TL;DR
* **PhaseSync, Ideaphase, & Ontos AI** – orchestration engines that make multi-agent AI systems behave. 
* **VIBE-Lock** – dev-shield CLI for watermarking, TPO, and obfuscation.  
* **Cannamind.ai & JIA Cellular Map** – applied AI for wellness and medical simulation.  
* **Bdprobuild.com** - AI generated responses accurately tuned to your specific shopping and project needs.
If a project kills friction and scales clean, my fingerprints are on it. 



## What I Do
| Area | Quick Take |

| **Workflow Architecture** | Design symbolic tagging + phase-aware dev pipelines that let humans & models ship predictably. |

| **Cognitive Systems** | Ontos AI: a self-regulater who routes tasks across agents. |

| **IP Defense** | VIBE-Lock: A CLI tool that keep your code from becoming someone else’s “training data.” If it's not too late. private license  | 



## ADLS Ecosystem<br>(Everything feeds everything)
| Project | Status | One-Liner |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **PhaseSync** |  Private | Universal CLI + IDE orchestration, rules before code. (v0.1 & v0.2 models) |
| **VIBE-Lock** |  Private | Watermark, timestamp, obfuscate—keep your signal sovereign. |
| **Cannamind.ai** |  Private Dev | Personalized cannabis wellness, AI-scored. |
| **ideaphase** |  Private Alpha Demo | Turns napkin ideas into tagged, AI-readable briefs. |
| **JIA Cellular Map** |  R&D | Auto-immune response simulator at cell resolution. |
| **BigDealsLLC610** |  Live | Local Shopify engine funding the R&D loop. |
| **Bdprobuild.com** |  Live |  AI generated responses accurately tuned to your specific shopping and project needs. |


## Operating Principles
* **Recursive Logic** – iterate until the system shows the answer.  
* **Symbolic Precision** – encode meaning, not just data.  
* **Cognitive Resonance** – align internals before shipping externals.  
* **Non-Reliance** – frameworks that self-validate; humans supervise, not babysit.



## Culture: Who Thrives Here
  **Builders** · **Recursive thinkers** · **Documentation first**  
**NO** Seat-warmers · Hierarchy lovers · “Raise cash first, figure it out later”

> “If you can’t bootstrap with what you already have, maybe it isn’t worth building yet.”
