# AI Workflow Architect | Symbolic Systems Engineer | Entropy Reduction Specialist #

Hello, I'm Donald Watts
I architect AI/ML development workflows that balance creative freedom with structural integrity using symbolic orchestration systems.

# About/Bio

With less than a year of formal coding experience, I’ve built high-level orchestration systems (like PhaseSync) that are actively used to reduce workflow entropy in AI/ML pipelines. My approach fuses symbolic tagging, recursive architecture, and phase-aware protocol enforcement — ensuring that both human and AI contributors can operate predictably at scale. 

I’m the creator of Ontosophic AI — a cognitive system designed to self-regulate task flow across multiple AI agents. I focus on building frameworks that solve the real bottlenecks of AI: not just model performance, but how the work gets done.

# What We Do: 

ADLS is more than a consultancy-it is an engine of recursive thinking and applied intelligence.
From streamlining logistics and developing AI tooling to simulating autoimmune behavior at the cellular level, our focus is consistent:
We don’t build features. We build frameworks.


# Every ADLS system is guided by a core principle:

Identify the problem. Solve it recursively. Build systems that require minimal intervention.
ADLS Consulting is the operational core.
ADLS Creations is the intellectual property engine.
Every other venture is living proof of our philosophy.


# The Portfolio: (In Motion)

BigDealsllc610.com : Revenue-first, lightweight Shopify AI-fueling future innovation. 

Cannamind.ai : Personalized cannabis wellness and recommendations app powered by AI and a proprietary scoring algorithm.  

PhaseSync : Universal orchestration for AI and developers (CLI, IDE, and rules-based). In active development

Idea Phase.app : A lightweight symbolic AI architecture tool that converts raw ideas into structured, tagged, and AI-readable documents. Free demo- working weights and tags.  

JIA Cellular Map: Medically-aligned AI simulation for autoimmune inflammation and treatment.

Ontosophic AI : Symbolic cognition engine with crypto-ledger logic, an ethics core, and a recursive agent system.

Each project supports and accelerates the next. This is strategy in action. This is sustainable scaling.


# How We Think:

Recursive Logic: We iterate solutions until the system itself reveals the optimal path.

Symbolic Precision: We architect meaning with clean, encoded representations-not just data.

Cognitive Resonance: Our systems align internally before they communicate externally.

Non-Reliance: We build for self-validation; our work speaks for itself.


# Who We Are (And Who We’re Not) 

# We are:

Builders.

Recursive thinkers.

Strategic executors.

Documenters before deployers.

Collaborators, not employers.

# We are not:

Here to “hire”-we partner with those who live their craft.

Dependent on investor handouts or traditional salary pipelines.

Interested in hierarchy for its own sake.

If you join ADLS, you enter a recursive loop of mastery-people working together at the edge of their abilities. We don’t clock hours; we scale expertise.
 Built by practitioners, not by those waiting for permission.
 

“If you can’t bootstrap your idea with what you already know and have, it probably wasn’t worth building to begin with.”


# Philosophy:

ADLS stands for:

Applied Intelligence

Documented Frameworks

Logical Recursion

Strategic Scaling

We don’t do hype. We do facts, functions, and forward motion.

We build clean. We move smart. We respect each other’s gifts.

# A Final Note to Collaborators #

You’re not joining a founder chasing attention. You’re joining a system already in motion.

We’re not here to raise capital to begin; we began long ago. Our focus is on finishing well.

ADLS is for those who do the work because it is their calling-finally routed into a system that matches their level.

If that resonates with you, welcome to ADLS.
